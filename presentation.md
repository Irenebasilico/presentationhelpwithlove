# Help With Love

## What is it about?

- My idea was to create a website about a charitable organization
- The project is called Help With Love, which collects food and other useful items by donation and then distributes them to those in need. 

This is the logo:

## Colour Palette

- These three warm colors were chosen as the basis of the website. This is because they convey tranquility and serenity.

# Home Page

## Structure of the web site
1. Navigation bar 
2. Project name
3. About the charity
4. Charity events
5. Become part of the team
6. Request of help
7. Footer

## Images
- Some of the images are from Pexels and Unsplash
- Some of them are created with AI

# Technologies Used

## HTML 

- Create the structure framework of the website. 
- The webside includes various links for navigation, such as: 
1. Document for contact and help
2. List of items
3. Social media accounts

## Links

- The links provide access to content I created so that the site would look more realistic. 
   - List of items I created with Adobe Express
   - The two questionnaires I created with Google Forms. 

## HTML BOOTSTRAP

+ Bootstrap simplifies the creation of responsive and aesthetically pleasing section of the website: 
  - Useful for creating the carousel of automatically changing images
  - Useful for creating the card in the section "if you need help"


## CSS
- There is an external css for the layout of the online site. With it I managed the aesthetic part of the site. 
+ Text and image management
    - example: transform: scale (1.05)
+ Aesthetic management of links: 
    - example: a:hover
- Media query is present, which allows the site to adapt to the characteristics of the smartphone: 
    - @media (max-width: 768px) 

## JAVASCRIPT

+ JavaScript made the website more authomatic and attractive:
- In the list of upcoming events, the date closest to the current date is highlighted. 
- In the newsletter section, once written, the email address is registered for 30 days.
